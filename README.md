Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook file rainfall_prediction.ipynb to access the project code. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the different steps of the rainfall prediction process.

Data Collection
The rainfall prediction model requires historical weather data, including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. You need to collect this data for your desired area from reliable sources, such as weather stations or meteorological agencies. Store the data in a structured format, such as a CSV file, where each row represents a specific time period (e.g., day or hour) and includes the relevant weather features and the corresponding rainfall amount.

Feature Engineering
Before training the model, it is crucial to preprocess and engineer the features appropriately. This step involves handling missing values, normalizing the data, and potentially creating new features based on domain knowledge.

Model Training
The model training phase involves splitting the data into training and testing sets. You will use the training set to train the machine learning model, such as a regression algorithm. Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance using the testing set.

Evaluation
To evaluate the model's performance, several metrics can be used, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts rainfall amounts based on the input features.

Deployment
After developing and evaluating the rainfall prediction model, you can deploy it in a production environment. This could involve creating a web application, API, or integrating it into an existing system to provide real-time or future rainfall predictions.
